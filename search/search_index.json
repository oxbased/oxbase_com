Follow @oxbased for updates. Node Details on Amboss forwards / month: ~50M sats ($25k) Minimum new channel size >5M sats Message me to open ballanced channels. How I manage it. I don't have any automation yet. Every week, I do the following. Adjust Fees Lower fees 5% on channels with high local balances. Raise fees 5% on channels with low local balance and try to rebalance. Balance Channels Use services to balance their respective channels. Move sats to Coinos.io wallet. Withdraw sats from River.com . Send sats to my Wallet of Satoshi Circular Rebalances: This almost never works for me at reasonable fee levels. Open / Close Channels If on chain fees are low <20 sats/vbyte: Close channels that I can't re-balance. Open channels to services I use. Open channels to nodes I think will earn routing fees. Things I've Learned Connecting to nodes that have many >100 channels rarely route anything. I suspect this is because many of their channels are not balanced so most attempted transactions fail. BTCPayserver When using Thunderhub to rebalance, many of the requests timeout because of my nginx settings from BTCPayserver. This is how you can edit the lnd settings in BTCPayserver. My Next Node Will be only a lightning node and nothing else. Still used a pruned bitcoin node to save hosting costs. Make 5M sats the minimum channel size. Use BOS or write logic to do what I've been doing manually. Don't use it as a personal node. Routing only. Connect my personal node.

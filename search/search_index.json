Every couple days, while I'm taking a deuce, I'll \"work on my node\". Lower fees 5% on channels with high local balances. Raise fees 5% on channels with low local balance and try to rebalance. Use services to balance there respective channels. Buy something on Fold Move sats to Coinos.io wallet. Withdraw sats from River.com . If fees are low <20 sats/vbyte: Close channels that I can't re-balance. Open channels to services I use. Open channels to nodes I think will earn routing fees. Things I've Learned Connecting to nodes that have many >100 channels rarely route anything. This is because many of their channels are not balanced so most attempted transactions fail. Many of the rebalancing, loop and even send from specific channel functions from Thunderhub 403 timeout because of limits in BTCPayserver. My Next Node Will be only a lightning node and nothing else. Still used a pruned bitcoin node because I don't want to pay to host a bitcoin node and I don't trust the reliability of my home internet to host a full bitcoin node here. Make 10M sats the minimum channel size Use BOS or write logic to do what I've been doing manually. Don't use it as a personal node. Routing only. Connect my personal node.
